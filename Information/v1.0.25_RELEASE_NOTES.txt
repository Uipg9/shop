This update completely overhauls the village system with an interconnected resource

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            RESOURCE ECONOMY SYSTEM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         WORKER SUPPLY CHAINS (8 WORKERS)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           BUILDING SYSTEM (10 BUILDINGS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buildings provide bonuses but have daily upkeep costs:

  • House: +1 worker slot (50 Wood, 2 Wood/day upkeep)
  • Granary: 2x food storage capacity (100 Wood + 50 Food, 1 Wood/day)
  • Warehouse: 2x resource storage capacity (150 Wood + 50 Ore, 2 Wood/day)
  • Farm Expansion: Farmers +1 food production (200 Wood, 3 Wood/day)
  • Mine Shaft: +20% ore production (300 Wood + 50 Ore, 5 Wood + 1 Ore/day)
  • Workshop: +10% ALL production! (250 Wood + 30 Ore, 5 Wood + 1 Tool/day)
  • Market: 2x sell value for resources (200 Wood + 100 Ore, 3 Wood + 1 Tool/day)
  • Trading Post: Merchant +50% money (300 Wood + 50 Ore, 4 Wood + 1 Tool/day)
  • Library: Better enchanted books (400 Wood + 100 Ore, 6 Wood + 1 Tool/day)

NOTE: Upkeep costs are only charged in Manual Mode, not in Auto-Manage Mode!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            FOOD & WORKER STATUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each worker needs 1 Food/day (Food or Fish counts):
  • Active: 100% production efficiency
  • Hungry (1 day without food): 50% efficiency
  • On Strike (2+ days without food): 0% efficiency

KEY INSIGHT: 1 Farmer produces 3 Food/day and can feed 3 workers!

Build a Barracks to prevent strikes entirely.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          VILLAGE LEVEL PROGRESSION

  • Start: 3 worker slots
  • Workers: Tier 1 only (Farmer, Lumberjack, Fisherman)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              AUTO-MANAGE MODE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Toggle between Manual and Auto-Manage modes in the village GUI:

MANUAL MODE:
  • 100% production efficiency
  • Must provide input resources for workers
  • Pay building upkeep costs daily
  • Full control and maximum output

AUTO-MANAGE MODE:
  • 70% production efficiency
  • NO input resources needed (workers produce from nothing)
  • NO building upkeep costs
  • Zero micromanagement - just collect profits!

Perfect for players who want passive income without resource management complexity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               TRADE CENTER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Separate storage system for exporting and selling village resources:

  • Transfer resources from village warehouse to trade center
  • Sell resources for money at their value-per-unit rates
  • Enable auto-sell to automatically sell resources daily
  • Upgrade storage capacity per resource type
  • Base capacity: 200 per resource type

Great for converting surplus production into passive daily income!

  - Resource availability (Manual Mode needs inputs)
  - Building bonuses (Workshop +10%, Market 2x sell value, etc.)

                             STRATEGY TIPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EARLY GAME (Hamlet):
  • Hire 1-2 Farmers FIRST (they produce food for other workers)
  • Then hire Lumberjack (wood is needed for everything)
  • Build Houses to expand worker slots
  • Save resources to upgrade to Village level (50 Food + 30 Wood)

MID GAME (Village → Town):
  • Hire Miners for ore production (needed for advanced items)
  • Build Workshop for +10% ALL production (very important!)
  • Build Warehouse/Granary for more storage
  • Upgrade key workers to increase production
  • Work toward Town level (200 Food + 100 Wood + 50 Ore)

LATE GAME (Town → City):
  • Hire Blacksmith for high-value Tools and Armor
  • Hire Merchants for direct money production
  • Build Market for 2x sell value (huge profit boost!)
  • Build Trading Post for +50% Merchant income
  • Consider Auto-Manage Mode if you want passive income with less effort

FOOD MANAGEMENT:
  • 1 Farmer = 3 Food/day = feeds 3 workers
  • Fishermen also produce food (2 Fish/day)
  • Build Granary for 2x food storage
  • Build Farm Expansion for +1 food per Farmer
  • Build Barracks if workers keep going on strike
