## 🎯 Pro Tips & Strategies

### 💎 Property Investment Strategy
1. **Start Small**: Buy Small Plot ($10k) → upgrade to Level 5
2. **Diversify**: Own at least one from each category
3. **Rent Wisely**: Rent out high-income properties only
4. **Save for Repairs**: Keep 15% of property value in reserve
5. **Research First**: Get "Property Mogul" before big purchases

### 📊 Stock Trading Strategy
1. **Watch Price Trends**: Check `/shop` prices before trading
2. **Small Positions**: Start with cheap items (wood, stone)
3. **Diversify**: Buy multiple small options vs one big one
4. **Exercise Early**: Take profits before expiration if in the money
5. **Cut Losses**: Don't hold losing positions hoping for turnaround

### 📈 Stock Market Strategy (NEW!)
1. **Start Small**: Begin with low-volatility stocks (Agriculture, Retail)
2. **Diversify Portfolio**: Own 5-10 different companies across industries
3. **Buy the Dip**: Purchase when prices drop 10%+ from recent highs
4. **Hold for Dividends**: Quarterly payouts (every 7 days) add up!
5. **Market Timing**: 
   - Bull market: Buy tech/high-volatility stocks for big gains
   - Bear market: Focus on dividends (Agriculture, Real Estate)
   - Neutral: Balanced portfolio across all industries
6. **Take Profits**: Sell when gains reach 20-30% for consistent income
7. **Dollar-Cost Average**: Buy same amount weekly regardless of price
8. **Watch the News**: Market events can cause 10-15% swings instantly
9. **Long-Term Wins**: Expected 10-15% annual returns if held patiently
10. **1% Fee Rule**: Minimize trades to reduce transaction costs

### 🎪 Auction House Strategy
1. **Bid Early**: NPCs less likely to counter early bids
2. **Instant Buy**: Worth it for epic items (20-30% markup)
3. **Check Daily**: Auctions reset at dawn - first bidder advantage
4. **Level Up**: Higher property levels unlock better items
5. **Snipe Endings**: Bid in last few seconds to avoid NPC counters

### 🕶️ Black Market Strategy
1. **15% Risk**: Expect to lose ~1 in 7 purchases
2. **Buy Bulk**: 3x Diamond Blocks at 70% off is worth the risk
3. **Have Backup**: Don't spend last money on black market
4. **Target High Value**: Only buy expensive items (Netherite+)
5. **Factor Scams**: Effective discount is 40-70% minus 15% scam rate
