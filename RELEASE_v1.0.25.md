Resources are stored in your village warehouse with upgradeable capacity (base: 200 per type).

---

## 👷 Worker Supply Chains (8 Workers)

Workers now consume inputs and produce outputs in an interconnected economy!

### Tier 1 - HAMLET (Level 1):
- **Farmer:** → 3 Food/day ($100 salary, $250 hire)
- **Lumberjack:** → 3 Wood/day ($80 salary, $200 hire)
- **Fisherman:** → 2 Fish/day ($70 salary, $180 hire)

### Tier 2 - VILLAGE (Level 2):
- **Miner:** 2 Food + 1 Wood → 2 Ore ($200 salary, $500 hire)
- **Rancher:** 3 Food → 2 Leather + 2 Wool ($120 salary, $300 hire)

### Tier 3 - TOWN (Level 3):
- **Blacksmith:** 2 Ore + 1 Wood → 1 Tool + 1 Armor ($150 salary, $400 hire)
- **Merchant:** Any 3 resources → Direct money ($180 salary, $600 hire)

### Tier 4 - CITY (Level 4):
- **Enchanter:** 1 Wood + 2 Ore → 1 Enchanted item ($250 salary, $1000 hire)

Workers can be upgraded **up to level 50** for increased production!

## 🏗️ Building System (10 Buildings)

Buildings provide powerful bonuses but have daily upkeep costs:

- **House:** +1 worker slot (50 Wood, 2 Wood/day upkeep)
- **Workshop:** +10% ALL production! (250 Wood + 30 Ore, 5 Wood + 1 Tool/day)
- **Market:** 2x sell value (200 Wood + 100 Ore, 3 Wood + 1 Tool/day)
- **Granary:** 2x food storage
- **Warehouse:** 2x resource storage
- **Farm Expansion:** Farmers +1 food
- **Mine Shaft:** +20% ore production
- **Trading Post:** Merchant +50%
- **Library:** Better enchanted books
- **Barracks:** No strikes

**Note:** Upkeep costs only apply in Manual Mode!

## 🍞 Food & Worker Status

Each worker needs **1 Food/day** (Food or Fish counts):
- **Active:** 100% efficiency
- **Hungry (1 day):** 50% efficiency
- **On Strike (2+ days):** 0% efficiency

💡 **Key Insight:** 1 Farmer produces 3 Food/day and can feed 3 workers!

Build a **Barracks** to prevent strikes entirely.

## 📈 Village Level Progression

### 4 Levels:
